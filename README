Rooter is a Vim plugin which changes the working directory to the project root
when you open a file.

More accurately, it'll do this when you open a typical webapp file.  These files
are identified by their extension.

The project root is identified by the presence of a DVCS directory.  Currently
git, darcs, mercurial and bazaar are supported.
